# QCR Marine Robotics Seminar Series

Welcome to the QUT Centre for Robotics, Marine Robotics Seminar Series â€” an initiative to bring together researchers, engineers, and students working at the intersection of marine science and robotics. With marine ecosystems under urgent and increasing pressure, it's never been more critical to accelerate the development and deployment of innovative technologies that can monitor, protect, and restore our oceans. Our sessions span a range of topics, from underwater computer vision and SLAM, to simulation tools, hardware design, and field deployments. Join us as we dive deep (haha) into the latest research shaping the future of marine robotics.

Watch this space for future seminars!

#### **30/01/2025 â€” Peter Smith and Alec Tutin, QUT**

**Bio:**  
Peter T. Smith is a Senior Research Engineer in the REF-RAS team at QUT and a co-founder of Blind Mystics â€“ a video game and software contracting company. Peter brings background skills in a unique blend of software engineering and video game development to marine robots. His area of expertise is robotic simulators and communication protocols, but his skills extend to all areas of marine autonomy.

Alec Tutin â€“ The other co-founder and shadowy figure who lurks in the dark.

**Abstract:**  
Robots are hard. Throwing robots into the sea? Now youâ€™re just asking for trouble. You had best be sure it's designed well before you do that. Marine simulators can help you spot and fix trouble before your expensive and time-consuming field trip days; this seminar will discuss what they are good at, what theyâ€™re not, and how to get started.

#### **15/05/2025 â€” Jonathan Sauder, EPFL**

**Bio:**  
Jonathan Sauder is a PhD student at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland working on the intersection of 3D computer vision, machine learning and coral reefs. Jonathan's research explores how recent breakthroughs in machine learning and computer vision can be used to create the next generation of coral monitoring tools. Previously, during his MSc at TU Berlin in computer science and BSc at the University of Potsdam, Jonathan worked on research in the intersection of machine learning, compressed sensing, and computer vision. 

**Abstract:**  
In light of the existential threat to coral reefs worldwide due to human activity, innovative monitoring strategies are demanded that are efficient, standardized, scalable, and economical. Mapping coral reefs from underwater videos in real time with consumer hardware could lead to the next generation of coral monitoring tools. However, coral reefs pose challenging conditions for 3D computer vision algorithms: the color degradation and blur induced by the water column, flickering caustics from sunlight hitting the wavy surface, and many moving or swaying objects (e.g. fish) often lead established systems to fail.

Self-supervised monocular SLAM emerges as a remedy, allowing to rapidly and robustly map large portions of reefs with cheap cameras without training on any ground-truth 3D information. An extension of this idea can be used to enhance existing imagery and make it suitable for conventional 3D mapping pipelines, which in turn can be used to create large-scale 3D datasets for supervised 3D foundation models. This translates to a real-world 3D semantic mapping system that is implemented in 6 countries of the Red Sea, used to analyze a steady stream of monitoring data from dozens of reef sites.
