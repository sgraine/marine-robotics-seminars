# ðŸŒŠ QCR Marine Robotics Seminar Series ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the QUT Centre for Robotics, Marine Robotics Seminar Series â€” an initiative to bring together researchers, engineers, and students working at the intersection of marine science and robotics. With marine ecosystems under urgent and increasing pressure, it's never been more critical to accelerate the development and deployment of innovative technologies that can monitor, protect, and restore our oceans. Our sessions span a range of topics, from underwater computer vision and SLAM, to simulation tools, hardware design, and field deployments. Join us as we dive deep (haha) into the latest research shaping the future of marine robotics.

Watch this space for future seminars!

#### **31/7/2025 â€” Dr Hui Sheng Lim, CSIRO**

**Bio:**  
Hui Sheng is a Hobart-based research engineer with a PhD in marine engineering. He specialises in developing autonomous marine systems for ocean observations, currently working with the Autonomous Sensors Future Science Platform at CSIRO. With a strong background in engineering and computational research in the maritime sector, Hui Sheng has a track record in developing and optimising AI applications for crewed and uncrewed marine systems, as well as modelling and simulating marine vehicles and ocean environments. Hui Sheng has led and contributed to a range of field deployments, algorithm development efforts, and collaborative research projects, with a focus on real-world impact and sustainable ocean observations. 

**Abstract:**  
The demand for timely, high-resolution ocean data is becoming increasingly critical, driven by climate change, the need for improved resource management and environmental monitoring of extreme events. Autonomous marine systems are emerging as a transformative solution. These systems enabling persistent, wide-area observations with reduced human input, offering new capabilities for real-time, adaptive decision-making at sea.   In this talk, Iâ€™ll share recent developments in marine robotics from CSIROâ€™s Autonomous Sensors Future Science Platform, focusing on mission planning algorithms and field-ready autonomy. Furthermore, it will cover the development of adaptive planning techniques, including variants of Monte Carlo Tree Search, evaluated against baseline behaviours across different environmental scenarios. This work is embedded within broader system development, including vehicle integration, onboard autonomy, and fleet operations.  I will also highlight science-driven field deployments where these systems can be applied, such as autonomous surveys for water quality monitoring and fish stock assessments. Through this integrated effort, we aim to advance scalable, adaptive solutions for real-time decision-making in complex oceanographic settings.

#### **15/05/2025 â€” Jonathan Sauder, EPFL**

**Bio:**  
Jonathan Sauder is a PhD student at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland working on the intersection of 3D computer vision, machine learning and coral reefs. Jonathan's research explores how recent breakthroughs in machine learning and computer vision can be used to create the next generation of coral monitoring tools. Previously, during his MSc at TU Berlin in computer science and BSc at the University of Potsdam, Jonathan worked on research in the intersection of machine learning, compressed sensing, and computer vision. 

**Abstract:**  
In light of the existential threat to coral reefs worldwide due to human activity, innovative monitoring strategies are demanded that are efficient, standardized, scalable, and economical. Mapping coral reefs from underwater videos in real time with consumer hardware could lead to the next generation of coral monitoring tools. However, coral reefs pose challenging conditions for 3D computer vision algorithms: the color degradation and blur induced by the water column, flickering caustics from sunlight hitting the wavy surface, and many moving or swaying objects (e.g. fish) often lead established systems to fail.

Self-supervised monocular SLAM emerges as a remedy, allowing to rapidly and robustly map large portions of reefs with cheap cameras without training on any ground-truth 3D information. An extension of this idea can be used to enhance existing imagery and make it suitable for conventional 3D mapping pipelines, which in turn can be used to create large-scale 3D datasets for supervised 3D foundation models. This translates to a real-world 3D semantic mapping system that is implemented in 6 countries of the Red Sea, used to analyze a steady stream of monitoring data from dozens of reef sites.

#### **13/03/2025 â€” Prof Rod Connolly, Griffith University**

**Bio:**  
Professor Rod Connolly is the Director of the Coast and Marine Research Centre at Griffith University and Director of the Global Wetlands Project.  He is an experienced marine scientist using automated monitoring technologies to measure fish abundance and ecosystem health on reefs, seagrass meadows, saltmarshes and mangroves.  Rodâ€™s key research interests span deep learning analysis of marine imagery; ecology of coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves; and effects of climate variability and pollution on marine ecosystems.

#### **30/01/2025 â€” Peter Smith and Alec Tutin, QUT**

**Bio:**  
Peter T. Smith is a Senior Research Engineer in the REF-RAS team at QUT and a co-founder of Blind Mystics â€“ a video game and software contracting company. Peter brings background skills in a unique blend of software engineering and video game development to marine robots. His area of expertise is robotic simulators and communication protocols, but his skills extend to all areas of marine autonomy.

Alec Tutin â€“ The other co-founder and shadowy figure who lurks in the dark.

**Abstract:**  
Robots are hard. Throwing robots into the sea? Now youâ€™re just asking for trouble. You had best be sure it's designed well before you do that. Marine simulators can help you spot and fix trouble before your expensive and time-consuming field trip days; this seminar will discuss what they are good at, what theyâ€™re not, and how to get started.
